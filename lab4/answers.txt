Part 1:

Exercise 1:
Read all files under each directory. Show match if "smutex" presents in the file.

./lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
./lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
./lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)
./lab3/sthread.cpp:void smutex_unlock(smutex_t *mutex)

Exercise 2:
`grep -r "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp`
`grep -r "return" *.h`

Exercise 3:
It returns function declarations that starts with "smutex". It tells how to call the functions
and the parameter information.

Exercise 4:
include/linux/blkdev.h

Exercise 5: 
It's a priority inheritance state structure, located in kernel/futex.c.

Exercise 6: 
3. In "include/linux/sched.h".

Exercise 7: 
3908.

Part 2:
(Exercise 8 is a coding exercise)


Exercise 9:
Line 15. I changed it from a do-while loop to while-do loop.
while (p){
    r += 1;
    p = p->next;
};

Exercise 10:
16

Exercise 11:
P_EMPTY

Exercise 12:
The value of reg->reg_intno is 0, so it goes to default.

(Exercise 13 is a coding exercise)



Part 3:

Exercise 14:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is:

Round-Robin

(Exercise 15 is a coding exercise)


Exercise 16:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1278.5 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800 ms

Average response time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5 ms
Average response time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480 ms


Exercise 17:

Did you complete Exercise 17A, Exercise 17B, or both?

17A

Exercise 18:


(Exercise 19 is a coding exercise)
